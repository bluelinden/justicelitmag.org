# The Tragedy of Orpheus

## Graham Sage

Gods, if only you knew what loss felt like,

Endless woe that I have to suffer,

Rivers of the dead, so close yet so far,

A cry from Hell, yet I cannot answer,

Loss is so much for me to take that,

Death would be a blessing…

Finding myself without her is hard enough,

O Reaper, I beg of thou, release me!

Release me from my bond to life, for

Death is my only blessing…

If I could take it all back, I would,

So broken am I without you…

Alas, now I must wander until that day comes

Living, I should for her sake

I see now, both light and darkness in it,

Victory and vanquishing on the battlefields of life,

Endless, this cycle is…
